# Python-Programming-Course
This repository contains the Python exercises I had to do in my first year
at Hogeschool Utrecht for a Programming Course. The book we used for this
course is **Introduction to Computing Using Python** by **Ljubomir Perkovic**.

The repository is divided into lessons by number, with each lesson containing
a file per practice exercise. File names are written using `pe(rkovic)_chapter.subchapter.py` format.

Beware that all comments are written in Dutch.
